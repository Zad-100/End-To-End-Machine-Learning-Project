# End-To-End-Machine-Learning-Project
&lt;p>This is a practice machine learning project, pretending to be a recently hired Data Scientist at a real estate company. This uses the Califiornia Housing Prices dataset from the StatLib repository.&lt;/p> &lt;p>This dataset is based on the data from the 1990 California census. This project is about building an ML model of housing prices in the state.&lt;/p>&lt;p>The model learns from this data and predicts the median housing price in any district, given all other metrics.&lt;/p>
